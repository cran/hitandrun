hitandrun 0.5-1
===============

Released 2015-04-18

 - Check for failures in findInteriorPoint and give clear errors.

hitandrun 0.5
=============

Released 2015-01-06

 - Add "Shake and Bake" method to sample from the boundary of polytopes.

 - Modify DESCRIPTION to conform to CRAN guidelines.

hitandrun 0.4-2
===============

Released 2014-08-04

 - Add parameter to skip the elimination of redundant constraints by
   hitandrun() and har.init().

 - hitandrun() and har.init() now correctly transform x0 if it is given.

 - Bugfix: createTransform(inverse=TRUE) failed if the dimensionality
   was reduced by more than one.

 - Expose eliminateRedundant in the NAMESPACE

 - Bugfix (upper|lower)BoundConstraint

 - Do not call rcdd::redundant with fewer than two constraints

 - Convert all C code to '.Call interface'

hitandrun 0.4-1
===============

Released 2014-01-14

 - Detect and handle degenerate sampling spaces

 - Use rational arithmetic in rcdd:: computations

hitandrun 0.4
=============

Released 2013-11-27

 - Add randomized slack LP for randomized starting point generation

 - Remove "extremes" method for starting point generation

hitandrun 0.3
=============

Released 2013-10-31

 - Add solution.basis, createTransform, and transformConstraints to deal
   with equality constraints

 - Add simplexConstraints to explicitly generate the constraints that
   define the n-simplex

 - Add hitandrun, har.init, and har.run to provide a generalized
   interface to har that handles equality and inequality constraints

 - Export findInteriorPoint to find an interior point of the polytope

 - Add hypersphere.sample for sampling uniformly from the unit
   hypersphere

 - Prefix C symbols with hitandrun_ to prevent name clashes

 - Update package documentation extensively

hitandrun 0.2-2
===============

Released 2013-08-22

 - Add the "slacklp" method for seed point generation
   (findInteriorPoint) (fixed #2)

 - Prevent dimension reduction of arrays using drop=FALSE on indexing
   operations

hitandrun 0.2-1
===============

Released 2013-07-11

 - Bugfix: "extremes" seed point generation sometimes generated points
   outside the polytope (fixed #1)

 - Documentation updates

hitandrun 0.2
=============

Released 2012-01-10

 - Initial CRAN release
